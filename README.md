LinkedIn Member or Company Plugin
===========

###What is it?

This is just a Joomla! content plugin to allow the use of a LinkedIn Member (or Company) button inside your contents.

###How to use it?

This plugin is simple to use like A-B-C; here you find the reference:

`{linkedinmcb URL (or company ID)|DISPLAY MODE (inline/hover/click/popup)|SHOW CONNECTIONS (true/false)}`

`Display Mode` and `Show connections` are optional parameters. If you don't input them, plugin will use the default settings (you can edit that in plugin settings).
